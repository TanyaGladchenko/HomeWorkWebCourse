    <h1>Political map of the World</h1>

        <p>This political map is designed to show governmental boundaries of countries and states,
            the location of some major cities, as well as significant bodies of water.
            Bright colors are used here to help you (the viewer) find the borders, and as you can see,
            most in the Caribbean and Europe are very hard to distinguish.
        <br>
